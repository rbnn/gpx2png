A small tool to produce images of your GPS track breadcrumbs over the top of
OSM mapping tile data.

Na√Øvely supports GPX, KML and KMZ files. If you have any other formats, for the
time being you can use `gpsbabel` to convert into GPX, and leave an issue if
you would like it natively supported.

<img src="example.png"><br />
To produce the above image from <b>example.kmz</b>, run <code><kbd>./gpx2png.py example.kmz</kbd></code>

TODO: this was made before the OSM move to a new licence, and needs further
work to support extra file types - as it appears the kml output from Tracks on
Android is not compatible with gpsbabel.

Requirements:
