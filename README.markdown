A small tool to produce images of your GPS track breadcrumbs over the top of
OSM mapping tile data.

Na√Øvely supports GPX files. If you have any other formats, for the
time being you can use `gpsbabel` to convert into GPX.

The tool is able to detect outliers based on the 99-percentile.

Usage: ./gpx2png.py [options] TRACK\_0.gpx [...TRACK\_N.gpx]

The program automatically concatenates the files 0 to N.

Available options:
  -o FILE   Write resulting image into FILE
  -w INT    Width of the track in pixels
  -c STR    Color of the track (e.g. blue, red, black,...)
  -z INT    Zoom-level of the background
  -p FLT    Change the percentile to FLT for outlier-suppression
  -v        Enable verbose output

More options can be set in the file config.py

Requirements:
  Pillow (http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/index.html)
